# 🛒 Order Management System (OMS)

A modular, console-based Order Management System developed using Python.  
This project demonstrates backend logic design, role-based access control, and file-based data persistence using JSON.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Order Management System (OMS) is a backend-focused application that simulates real-world order handling in a structured environment.  

The system supports two types of users:

- **Customer**
- **Admin**

Each role has separate functionalities, ensuring clear separation of responsibilities and controlled access to data.

The project is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and follows a modular file structure for better readability and scalability.
